# Cryptography Project 2 - Type 3
## Computation Over Outsourced Encrypted Data via Homomorphic Encryption
### By: Avani Tiwari, Jonathan Guan, Jeffrey Rathgeber


    GENERAL INFO
The goal of our project is to allow for the querying of a function over 
externally-stored encrypted data, without the need for decryption of the data 
itself. This ensures that user data is secure from any malicious actor with access 
to where the data is stored, during the entire process of computation, and allows 
for data to be put to use while maintaining security and integrity.
